    /* Merge serialisation/deserialisation */
    struct {
        /* Design note: On large_obj handling.

           Before merge checkpointing, we could assume that a cct only contained/owned a
           valid non-zero large_objs list if it was "complete" (i.e. not being produced
           through a merge operation). While a merge was underway, we would produce a
           large objects list to hold results of the ongoing merge. This list was owned by
           the merge, and populated from da_entry_add.  When the merge was complete, the
           merge passes ownership of the large_objs list to the cct through a list_replace
           operation in da_merge_package.

           There are a couple of issues here w.r.t. merge checkpointing. Firstly, on the
           serialisation side, we would need to maintain a list of large_objs corresponding
           to the serialised state of the tree. This list of large_objs would be written
           back during checkpoint. This by itself is not an issue - we simply need to
           maintain a list that is accessible to the checkpoint thread, i.e. right here in
           the double_array structure. That list would have to be deallocated at rmmod
           time so we don't violate any ref_cnt sanity checks on the large_objects, since
           it is currently assumed that each LO would only have 1 reference to it.

           Secondly, we would need to deserialise this list of large_objs. In order to
           reuse the current deserialisation scheme (as in castle_da_read), we would have
           to create a large_obj list onto the deserialising tree. The alternative is to
           handle deserialisation of the incomplete output tree outside the standard path,
           but that will require changes to the standard deserialisation path anyway since
           at least one sanity check will fail (i.e. it will find large_objs linked to
           ccts that it cannot find). Furthermore, we would have to mark the LO extents
           live so they are not removed prematurely.

           Therefore, while a merge is ongoing, by design, the output tree under merge has
           a list of large_obj that corresponds to it's serialised state. When the merge is
           completed this list is completed. If a merge is aborted, this list must be
           dropped (after it has been checkpointed) in order to avoid a bad ref count
           sanity check. After deserialising, the tree once again has a list of large_obj
           that corresponds to the serialised state - therefore symmetry is maintained and
           a deserialised tree would be indistinguishable from a newly created one in mid-
           merge.

           (This symmetry could also have been maintained by allowing the output cct
           to always hold it's "live" state (since at deserialisation time, serialised
           state == live state), but that would have then required maintenance of 3 lists:
           a "live list", a "serialised list", and a "new list" which is the diff between
           the live list and the serialised list. In practice we only need the serialised
           list and the new list, since the live list is worthless until the merge
           completes anyway.)

           For this reason we need to maintain a pointer to the output tree in this struct,
           and in the case of an aborted merge, the output tree must persist beyond
           merge_dealloc so that it can be written out by the final checkpoint before being
           dropped by da_dealloc.
